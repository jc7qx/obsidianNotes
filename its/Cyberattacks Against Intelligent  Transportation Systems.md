6 ITS applications and systems (A&S)

Vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, etc.) are fundamental components of transportation. Equipped with internet access and also has a wireless Local Area Network (LAN), which allows it to share internet access with other devices. A more advanced version of the connected vehicle which can sense its environment and navigate without human input using a variety of technologies such as LIDAR, RADAR, GPS, stereoscopic cameras, etc.

Roadway Reporting
road operators need to constantly monitor traffic and current roadway conditions using an extensive array of cameras and sensors that are strategically placed all across the roadway and which sends back data real-time to the control center, including bus lane cameras, speed cameras, roadside weather stations, and vehicle detection systems.

Traffic Flow Controls
Road operators monitor traffic and roadway conditions in real-time and use gathered data to manage traffic flow using various flow-control mechanisms including traffic signal control systems, railway crossing barriers, dynamic message signs, and automated toll collection systems.

Payment Applications and Systems
increase their revenue stream while reducing costs including RFID payments/tags, kiosk payment machines, and e-ticket applications.


Management Applications and Systems
ITS nerve centers host, monitor, and operate the management systems controlling ITS. including streetlight controls, disaster management, data and data storage management, emergency vehicle management, and traffic and congestion management.

Communications Applications and Systems
Data is used for making traffic flow efficient, improving road safety, increasing revenue, and reducing ecological and environmental impact, among other uses. Data is also consumed by the users of ITS services to improve their transit options and experiences. Examples include: smart apps, social media, websites, and road obstacle and accident alerts.
