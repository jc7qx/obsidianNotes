# What is non-repudiation?

Non-repudiation is the assurance that someone cannot deny the validity of something. 
Non-repudiation is a legal concept that is widely used in information security and refers to a service, which provides proof of the origin of data and the integrity of the data. In other words, non-repudiation makes it very difficult to successfully deny who/where a message came from as well as the authenticity and integrity of that message.

Digital signatures (combined with other measures) can offer non-repudiation when it comes to online transactions, where it is crucial to ensure that a party to a contract or a communication can't deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or sending the communication in the first place. In this context, non-repudiation refers to the ability to ensure that a party to a contract or a communication must accept the authenticity of their signature on a document or the sending of a message.
