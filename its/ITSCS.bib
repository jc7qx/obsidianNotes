  abstract = {Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is a key technology in the domain of transportation which serves as a platform for vehicles to communicate with each other and intelligently exchange critical information, such as collision avoidance messages. Given that potentially life critical information could be exchanged in real time among network entities, it is paramount that this information is authentic (from a legitimate source), reliable and accurate. Moreover, mobility of vehicles creates different contexts in VANET resulting in a diversity of requirements for trust management. This work focuses on the effective modelling and management of trust both as a prerequisite to inter-vehicle communication and as a security measure. To this end, we propose a comprehensive set of criteria which work towards the effective modelling and management of trust in VANET to ensure that the unique characteristics of the network (such as high mobility, dispersion of vehicles, and lack of central architecture) are considered. The contribution of this paper is twofold. (1) We propose 16 criteria for effective trust management in VANET, and (2) evaluate various available trust models based on these proposed criteria.},

Also Current VANET security standards handle the bulk of the security issues that vehicle networks confront. This paper presents VANET's different types of security attacks in a systematic review approach. The information was gathered by a systematic examination of existing research articles. However, as technology is growing and VANETs are getting more popular, security vulnerabilities are increasing rapidly, which ultimately restricts the widespread usage of the VANETs. In this article, the security vulnerabilities of VANETs are surveyed. The article also provides layer-specific attack classification in the VANETS protocol stack.},

This cyber-physical system detects the number of riders waiting for the bus system at each bus station and number of riders on each bus. In this paper, we examine the security and vulnerability of the bus data collection system and provide remedies. Smart units are used to collect data (e.g., Media Access Control (MAC) Addresses) to uniquely identify students' smart phone waiting times for the bus at each station. The goals of this system are to identify the average waiting times at each bus station, route optimization and dynamic routing. Several security concerns occur with the collection, transmission, and storage of data in the Cloud (e.g., Man in the middle attacks, unauthorized access, denial of services, theft, etc). We analyze some of these cyber-attack vectors and provides mitigation techniques, cyber hygiene best practices, and suggest ways to balance security versus convenience.},

With continuously growing security threats, vehicles could be exposed to a number of service attacks that could put their safety at stake. To address this concern, both US and European ITS standards have selected Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithms to secure vehicular communications. However, there is still a lack of benchmarking studies on existing security standards in real-world settings. In this paper, we first analyze the security architecture of the ETSI ITS standard. We then implement the ECC based digital signature and encryption procedures using an experimental test-bed and conduct an extensive benchmark study to assess their performance which depends on factors such as payload size, processor speed and security levels. Using network simulation models, we further evaluate the impact of standard compliant security procedures in dense and realistic smart cities scenarios. Obtained results suggest that existing security solutions directly impact the achieved quality of service (QoS) and safety awareness of vehicular applications, in terms of increased packet inter-arrival delays, packet and cryptographic losses, and reduced safety awareness in safety applications. Finally, we summarize the insights gained from the simulation results and discuss open research challenges for efficient working of security in ITS applications of smart cities.},

``The key requirements of a secure vehicular network includes availability that guarantees transmission of data within latency requirements using low overhead and light weight cryptographic algorithms. Confidentiality makes vehicle identities and data completely anonymous. Authentication is another key security feature that ensures messages are sent by a legitimate ITS station, the surrounding traffic locations are correctly verified and data attacks from malicious users are prevented. To define proper data access control for different ITS stations, authorization is a vital security requirement. Moreover, data integrity and validation that the data has not been tempered by a malicious user is another security challenge.'' (Javed and Znaidi, 2016, p. 4)

``eavesdropping and data interception are attacks that let malicious users access the sensitive information in the transmitted messages. Encryption is an effective cryptographic solution against such attacks. Vehicle authentication and authorization is compromised by attacks such as falsified entities, cryptographic replication, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing, and timing attacks.'' (Javed and Znaidi, 2016, p. 4)
\par
``Data Integrity is impacted by attacks such as Masquerading in which a vehicle uses a valid network identifier to broadcast itself as an emergency vehicle and thus effects movement of other vehicles. Another type of attack known as Data Playback attack in which malicious vehicles rebroadcast old messages within the network to generate false vehicle positions. Similarly, data alteration attacks can modify, delete or change the message content to create ambiguity in the network. Digital signature with certificate is a robust mechanism to minimize threats due to these attacks.'' (Javed and Znaidi, 2016, p. 5)

  abstract = {Due to the growing number of vehicles on the roads worldwide, road traffic accidents are currently recognized as a major public safety problem. In this context, connected vehicles are considered as the key enabling technology to improve road safety and to foster the emergence of next generation cooperative intelligent transport systems (ITS). Through the use of wireless communication technologies, the deployment of ITS will enable vehicles to autonomously communicate with other nearby vehicles and roadside infrastructures and will open the door for a wide range of novel road safety and driver assistive applications. However, connecting wireless-enabled vehicles to external entities can make ITS applications vulnerable to various security threats, thus impacting the safety of drivers. This article reviews the current research challenges and opportunities related to the development of secure and safe ITS applications. It first explores the architecture and main characteristics of ITS systems and surveys the key enabling standards and projects. Then, various ITS security threats are analyzed and classified, along with their corresponding cryptographic countermeasures. Finally, a detailed ITS safety application case study is analyzed and evaluated in light of the European ETSI TC ITS standard. An experimental test-bed is presented, and several elliptic curve digital signature algorithms (ECDSA) are benchmarked for signing and verifying ITS safety messages. To conclude, lessons learned, open research challenges and opportunities are discussed.},

Hackers, researchers, and car hobbyists have compromised security keys used by the electronic control units (ECUs) on vehicles, modified ECU software, and hacked wireless transmissions from vehicle key fobs and tire monitoring sensors, using low-cost commercially available tools. However, the most damaging security threats to vehicles are only emerging. One such threat is malware, which can infect vehicles in a variety of ways and cause severe consequences. Defending vehicles against malware attacks must address many unique challenges that have not been well addressed in other types of networks. This paper identifies those vehicle-specific challenges, discusses existing solutions and their limitations, and presents a cloud-assisted vehicle malware defense framework that can address these challenges.},

There has been considerable work addressing security in vehicular network systems for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) usages. We examine the risks and proposed security solutions in this space. Our analysis leads to several key observations. The current security work misses many practical ITS usage and security requirements, since it fails to consider practical economic models and critical ITS functional requirements as a control system. Consequently, the standardized ITS communication message authenticity solutions have little utility relative to addressing the real threats. Furthermore, we discovered that fundamental re-thinking of the public key infrastructure support for secure vehicular communication is essential, because of the multi-stakeholder and cross-domain nature of many ITS usages. Based on our analysis, we call for future research directions in analyzing practical problems and designing solutions to secure vehicular communication in order to achieve its full potential.}

Studying big data analytics in ITS is a flourishing field. This paper first reviews the history and characteristics of big data and intelligent transportation systems. The framework of conducting big data analytics in ITS is discussed next, where the data source and collection methods, data analytics methods and platforms, and big data analytics application categories are summarized. Several case studies of big data analytics applications in intelligent transportation systems, including road traffic accidents analysis, road traffic flow prediction, public transportation service plan, personal travel route plan, rail transportation management and control, and assets maintenance are introduced. Finally, this paper discusses some open challenges of using big data analytics in ITS.},
