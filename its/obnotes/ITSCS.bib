These intelligent vehicles interact with one other or with the road side unit (RSU) for providing safer roads and a more efficient driving experience and providing security against attackers. In VANET messages are conveyed in an open wireless channels Security is therefore the most concerning issue in VANET.

  abstract = {Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is a key technology in the domain of transportation which serves as a platform for vehicles to communicate with each other and intelligently exchange critical information, such as collision avoidance messages. Given that potentially life critical information could be exchanged in real time among network entities, it is paramount that this information is authentic (from a legitimate source), reliable and accurate. Moreover, mobility of vehicles creates different contexts in VANET resulting in a diversity of requirements for trust management. This work focuses on the effective modelling and management of trust both as a prerequisite to inter-vehicle communication and as a security measure. To this end, we propose a comprehensive set of criteria which work towards the effective modelling and management of trust in VANET to ensure that the unique characteristics of the network (such as high mobility, dispersion of vehicles, and lack of central architecture) are considered. The contribution of this paper is twofold. (1) We propose 16 criteria for effective trust management in VANET, and (2) evaluate various available trust models based on these proposed criteria.},

In VANET, the vehicles communicate or collaborate with each other and with adjacent infrastructure by exchanging significant messages, such as road accident warnings, steep-curve ahead warnings or traffic jam warnings. However, this communication and other assets involved are subject to major threats and provide numerous opportunities for attackers to launch several attacks and compromise security and privacy of vehicular users. This paper reviews the cyber security in VANET and proposes an asset-based approach for VANET security. Firstly, it identifies relevant assets in VANET. Secondly, it provides a detailed taxonomy of vulnerabilities and threats on these assets, and, lastly, it classifies the possible attacks in VANET and critically evaluates them.},

VANETs are a subset of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) that refer to a group of connected cars. The various networking layers in common Internet protocol stack topologies are linked to security vulnerabilities in VANETs. A security breach in a VANET is typically serious and harmful. Also Current VANET security standards handle the bulk of the security issues that vehicle networks confront. This paper presents VANET's different types of security attacks in a systematic review approach. The information was gathered by a systematic examination of existing research articles. However, as technology is growing and VANETs are getting more popular, security vulnerabilities are increasing rapidly, which ultimately restricts the widespread usage of the VANETs. In this article, the security vulnerabilities of VANETs are surveyed. The article also provides layer-specific attack classification in the VANETS protocol stack.},

Currently, cyber threats range from Trojans and viruses to botnets and toolkits. Presently, 96\% of mobile devices do not have pre-installed security software while approximately 65\% of the vulnerabilities are found within the application layer. This lack in security and policy driven systems is an opportunity for malicious cyber attackers to hack into the various popular devices. Traditional security software found in desktop computing platforms, such as firewalls, antivirus, and encryption, is widely used by the general public in mobile devices. Moreover, mobile devices are even more vulnerable than personal desktop computers because more people are using mobile devices to do personal tasks. This review attempts to display the importance of developing a national security policy created for mobile devices in order to protect sensitive and confidential data.},

The five layered architecture of VANET is formed from optimizing the seven layer Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model and its functionalities are dealt in this work. High mobility and dynamic topologies always lead to intermittent the Quality of Service (QoS), higher delay and packet dropping issues in the network. It is prime importance to ensure VANETs security as their deployment in the future must not compromise the safety and privacy of their users. The vehicles in VANET always need to be connected with the target network. Many decision making schemes are surveyed and presented in this work.

This cyber-physical system detects the number of riders waiting for the bus system at each bus station and number of riders on each bus. In this paper, we examine the security and vulnerability of the bus data collection system and provide remedies. Smart units are used to collect data (e.g., Media Access Control (MAC) Addresses) to uniquely identify students' smart phone waiting times for the bus at each station. The goals of this system are to identify the average waiting times at each bus station, route optimization and dynamic routing. Several security concerns occur with the collection, transmission, and storage of data in the Cloud (e.g., Man in the middle attacks, unauthorized access, denial of services, theft, etc). We analyze some of these cyber-attack vectors and provides mitigation techniques, cyber hygiene best practices, and suggest ways to balance security versus convenience.},

The security of these VANETs is essential for the benefit of secure and effective security solutions and facilities, and uncertainty remains, and research in this field remains fast increasing. We discussed the challenges in VANET in this survey. Were vehicles and communication in VANET are efficient to ensure communication between vehicles to vehicles (V2V), vehicles to infrastructures (V2I). Clarified security concerns have been discussed, including confidentiality, authentication, integrity, availableness, and nonrepudiation. We have also discussed the potential attacks on security services. According to analysis and performance evaluations, this paper shows that the ACPN is both feasible and appropriate for effective authentication in the VANET.

  abstract = {Connecting vehicles securely and reliably is pivotal to the implementation of next generation ITS applications of smart cities. With continuously growing security threats, vehicles could be exposed to a number of service attacks that could put their safety at stake. To address this concern, both US and European ITS standards have selected Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithms to secure vehicular communications. However, there is still a lack of benchmarking studies on existing security standards in real-world settings. In this paper, we first analyze the security architecture of the ETSI ITS standard. We then implement the ECC based digital signature and encryption procedures using an experimental test-bed and conduct an extensive benchmark study to assess their performance which depends on factors such as payload size, processor speed and security levels. Using network simulation models, we further evaluate the impact of standard compliant security procedures in dense and realistic smart cities scenarios. Obtained results suggest that existing security solutions directly impact the achieved quality of service (QoS) and safety awareness of vehicular applications, in terms of increased packet inter-arrival delays, packet and cryptographic losses, and reduced safety awareness in safety applications. Finally, we summarize the insights gained from the simulation results and discuss open research challenges for efficient working of security in ITS applications of smart cities.},

  abstract = {Due to the growing number of vehicles on the roads worldwide, road traffic accidents are currently recognized as a major public safety problem. In this context, connected vehicles are considered as the key enabling technology to improve road safety and to foster the emergence of next generation cooperative intelligent transport systems (ITS). Through the use of wireless communication technologies, the deployment of ITS will enable vehicles to autonomously communicate with other nearby vehicles and roadside infrastructures and will open the door for a wide range of novel road safety and driver assistive applications. However, connecting wireless-enabled vehicles to external entities can make ITS applications vulnerable to various security threats, thus impacting the safety of drivers. This article reviews the current research challenges and opportunities related to the development of secure and safe ITS applications. It first explores the architecture and main characteristics of ITS systems and surveys the key enabling standards and projects. Then, various ITS security threats are analyzed and classified, along with their corresponding cryptographic countermeasures. Finally, a detailed ITS safety application case study is analyzed and evaluated in light of the European ETSI TC ITS standard. An experimental test-bed is presented, and several elliptic curve digital signature algorithms (ECDSA) are benchmarked for signing and verifying ITS safety messages. To conclude, lessons learned, open research challenges and opportunities are discussed.},

We have reviewed, analyzed, and discussed the proficient researcher's works and their contributions in this paper to unfold new directions in the present and future research. Further, we have analyzed and discussed the insurance, and forensic management is amalgamated with Blockchain by various researchers to create an automatic assessment protocol.

Future trends in IoT allow these inter networks to share information. Also, the previous security solutions to vehicular IoT (VIoT) much emphasize on privacy protection and security related issues using public keys infrastructure. However, the primary concern about efficient trust assessment, authorized users malfunctioning, and secure information dissemination in vehicular wireless networks have not been explored. To cope with these challenges, we propose a trust enhanced on-demand routing (TER) scheme, which adopts TrustWalker (TW) algorithm for efficient trust assessment and route search technique in VIoT. TER comprised of novel three-valued subjective logic (3VSL), TW algorithm, and ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol. The simulated results validate the accuracy of the proposed scheme in term of throughput, packet drop ratio (PDR), and end to end (E2E) delay. In the simulation, the execution time of the TW algorithm is analyzed and compared with another route search algorithm, i.e., Assess-Trust (AT), by considering real-world online datasets such as Pretty Good Privacy and Advogato. The accuracy and efficiency of the TW algorithm, even with a large number of vehicle users, are also demonstrated through simulations.},

In this paper, we study the ability of the support vector machines (SVM) to predict the probability of reincarceration. As a semi parametric approach, the SVM minimizes structural risk whereas nonparametric models, such as neural networks, minimize empirical risk. Furthermore, the SVM differs significantly from existing parametric models, such as logistic regression, in prediction of criminal recidivism. Due to the relatively new application of the SVM in predicting criminal recidivism in the field of criminology, a general framework is presented for how the SVM may become a supplemental or alternative method for recidivism prediction. Comparisons among logistic regression, neural networks, and the SVM are made with empirical testing results on a well-known recidivism data set. A combined prediction utilizing all three methods provides the most flexibility and accuracy in decision-making.},

However, the most damaging security threats to vehicles are only emerging. One such threat is malware, which can infect vehicles in a variety of ways and cause severe consequences. Defending vehicles against malware attacks must address many unique challenges that have not been well addressed in other types of networks.

  abstract = {It is discovered that fundamental re-thinking of the public key infrastructure support for secure vehicular communication is essential, because of the multi-stakeholder and cross-domain nature of many ITS usages. There has been considerable work addressing security in vehicular network systems for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) usages. We examine the risks and proposed security solutions in this space. Our analysis leads to several key observations. The current security work misses many practical ITS usage and security requirements, since it fails to consider practical economic models and critical ITS functional requirements as a control system. Consequently, the standardized ITS communication message authenticity solutions have little utility relative to addressing the real threats. Furthermore, we discovered that fundamental re-thinking of the public key infrastructure support for secure vehicular communication is essential, because of the multi-stakeholder and cross-domain nature of many ITS usages. Based on our analysis, we call for future research directions in analyzing practical problems and designing solutions to secure vehicular communication in order to achieve its full potential.}

  abstract = {Big data is becoming a research focus in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which can be seen in many projects around the world. Intelligent transportation systems will produce a large amount of data. The produced big data will have profound impacts on the design and application of intelligent transportation systems, which makes ITS safer, more efficient, and profitable. Studying big data analytics in ITS is a flourishing field. This paper first reviews the history and characteristics of big data and intelligent transportation systems. The framework of conducting big data analytics in ITS is discussed next, where the data source and collection methods, data analytics methods and platforms, and big data analytics application categories are summarized. Several case studies of big data analytics applications in intelligent transportation systems, including road traffic accidents analysis, road traffic flow prediction, public transportation service plan, personal travel route plan, rail transportation management and control, and assets maintenance are introduced. Finally, this paper discusses some open challenges of using big data analytics in ITS.},
